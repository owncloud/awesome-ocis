# Awesome oCIS

An opinionated list of awesome [ownCloud Infinite Scale](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis) apps, extensions, services and other resources.

This repository does not contain any code but references the sourcing repositories. It is therefore just a reference list. Some of the web apps are used via the deployment examples in the [admin docs](https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/ubuntu-compose-prod.html) and have their origin in the [web-extensions](https://github.com/owncloud/web-extensions) repository while others use external repositories and need to be added manually to the web UI - you can use the `web-extensions` repo as example for a how-to.

## Attention please!

> :warning: While we are proud to present you these resources, we can't give any guarantees that they will work for you or that they will be stable. Feel free to open issues in the respective, linked repositories or contribute to the projects in any other way.

If you'd like to contribute to this list, please feel free to make a pull request.

## ownCloud Apps and Extensions

Please follow the steps provided in our [developer documentation](https://owncloud.dev/services/web/#web-apps) if you want to install any of the
external sourced apps and extensions. For some of them there are released artifacts, others still need to be built from source code.

> :information_source: The app and extension installation as described in the developer documentation linked above is available in `oCIS v6.0.0` or later.

### Build your own

If you want to build your own apps and extensions, the place to start is our [app boilerplate](https://github.com/owncloud/web-app-skeleton).
